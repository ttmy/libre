# Company by Laws
### Partner agreements
To avoid any conflict between founders, all co-founders must sign a comprehensive operational agreement. The agreement should define the founders' relationship, provide the expectation that all work will belong to some entity in the future, and outline a basic communication and dispute resolution clause that can help prevent disputes.
### Policies within the company
To ensure that a startup works with as few complications as possible, founders must formulate strong bylaws immediately. Bylaws must establish the company's internal rules, such as how to resolve disputes, select leadership, and determine shareholder rights and powers. Most importantly, bylaws must set voting thresholds for approvals of certain corporation shares, such as electing new board members or borrowing.

# Contracts
### Providing services
 - Software development
### Labour
These legal documents are key to ensuring employees understand what is expected of them. They should clearly state the following.
 - Terms of employment (e.g. compensation, role responsibilities, hours of work, and reasons for termination)
 - Reporting structure
 - IP property ("intellectual property") in English) of work
 - Commitments made
 - Company policies (e.g. vacation days, paid free time structure, dress code)
### Confidentiality agreement
Have an easily accessible confidentiality agreement (NDA) before any business conversation takes place between you and a third party. From the moment a potential employee or investor walks through your door, you need to have an NDA agreement waiting for them to sign. NDDs protect their inception by safeguarding the ideas of their founder and employees and their intellectual property. An NDA must specify the following:
 - What constitutes confidential information
 - How confidential information should be handled
 - Who owns that information (the company)
 - The period of time in which the information will be disclosed
 - The confidentiality of the time period will be maintained
 ### Intellectual property
An IP allocation agreement could be the key legal document that determines whether your startup can attract the investments you need to grow. This is especially true for technology companies, because it is often the value of their IP portfolio that investors and venture capital firms are evaluating.

Startup founders must have full ownership of all written IP assets to avoid costly claims filed by patent trolls and companies trying to copy their business model, among others. During the formation of a new company, a good practice is to assign the company all the relevant intellectual property. There are two types of IP allocation agreements to consider:
 - Technology Allocation Agreements assign startups any intellectual property created before forming the company. Developers may, in certain cases, retain individual IP ownership rights, or may sell their rights in exchange for capital or cash.
 - The Invention Assignment Agreements assign the new IP-owned company any relevant work product created by employees after the company's training. A confidentiality and invention assignment agreement is usually signed by the founder(s) and employees. The company will own all rights to the IP portfolio.
